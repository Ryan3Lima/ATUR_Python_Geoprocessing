# ATUR_Python_Geoprocessing

This Repository is intended to hold juptyer notebooks or google Colab notebooks that can serve as guides for processing data related to the Arizona Tri-University Recharge Project

### Basics:

#### Github
##### What is Github?
Github is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It primarily hosts repositories for storing and managing code, making it easier for developers to work together on projects. 

##### Key features include
- Repositories
Storage spaces for projects where files, documentation,and code are kept. Repositories can be public or private

- Version Control
Use Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to code, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simulaneously
  
- Collaboration
Facilitates collaboration through features like pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes to a codebase, and issue tracking for managing bugs and features requests.
  
- Branching and Merging
Developers can create banches to work on features or fixes independently of the main codebase and then merge changes back when ready
 
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Development
 Integrates with various CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment of Code.

- Documentation and Wikis
 Supports comprehnsive project documentation and wikis for better project managmment and knowledge sharing.

- Community and Social Features
Users can follow other developers, star respositors to show appreciation, and fork respositories to create personal copies for experimentation.
 
#### Google Colab 
#### Juptyer Notebooks
### Setup 1 - Jupyter Notebooks

### Setup 2 - Google Colab



##  Recommended Workflow Setup 1

Requires:
 - Github Account


I recommend cloneing this repo, and going through the steps to Learn basic github [Github Basic Skills](https://github.com/Ryan3Lima/skills-introduction-to-github)
 - Github Desktop
 - Anaconda
 - conda environment with python 3.9

[anaconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)

[Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Processes included with this workflow 

#### Combine Rasters into Mosaic

based on tutorial from this medium article: [How to Mosaic/Merge Raster Data in Python](https://medium.com/spatial-data-science/how-to-mosaic-merge-raster-data-in-python-fb18e44f3c8)

##### TO DO
  - Ryan to fix errors
  - untitled jupyter notebook - rename Combine Rasters into Mosaic when bugs are fixed

### Processes to include:

#### Getting Data from Cyverse
#### Exporting Data to Cyverse
#### Other suggestions?
